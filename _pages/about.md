## EDUCATION
**University of Michigan**
- MS student in Industrial and Operations Engineering(2022.08-Present)
<br>

**University of Science and Technology of China**
- B.Sc. in Statistics, *Distinguished Graduates Award*(2014.08-2018.06)

  Bachelor Thesis: *"Stock Market Predictability Estimation with Machine Learning"*. We proved and measured the incomplete efficiency of the stock market by constructing some clever market cases that are predictable by some 'not-fancy' machine learning methods.

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

**Data Center Brain Lab, Alibaba Cloud Computing Co. Ltd.**(2018-2022)
  - Supply Chain Demand Forecast: My team focused on supply chain demand forecast method to better optimize the stocking strategy of millions of cloud computing servers. Our latest method(till I resign) gains no less than 5% in MAPE compared to any published method(Prophet/Amazon Forecast/etc.). Our work leaded to more than $100 million cost saving per year(since I joined). 
  - Establishment of Enterprises Knowledge Graph: By portraying our tens of millions of enterprise customers with data-driven methods on massive data(~TB) as domain knowledge, we optimized our all-scenario models significantly with knowledge graph embedding. Our significance included but not limited to:
    - customer churning prediction
    - commodity recommendation system

**Joint Intelligent Computing Lab of USTC and Birmingham University, University of Science and Technology of China**(2017-2018)
  - We tackles Submodularity Subset Selection under various constraints(NP-hard). Considering the traditional stable solution with an approximation ratio of 1/e, we try to find a better solution based on stocastic methods (from the perspective of probability and computing efficiency instead of a better approximation ratio)
