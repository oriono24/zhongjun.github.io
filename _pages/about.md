### Education
======
**School of Management, University of Science and Technology of China**
*Hefei, China*
- Bachelor of Science in Statistics, honoured graduates(2014.08-2018.06)

**Graduation Thesis**: "Stock Market Predictability Estimation with Machine Learning". We proved and measured the incomplete efficiency of the stock market by constructing some clever market cases that are predictable by some 'not-fancy' machine learning methods.

  - Supply Chain Demand Forecast: My team focused on supply chain demand forecast method to better optimize the stocking strategy of millions of servers (cloud computing resources). Our latest method gains no less than 5% in MAPE compared to any published method(Prophet/Amazon Forecast/or any traditional statistical time series prediction method). Our work leaded to more than 100 million$ cost saving per year(since I joined). 
  - Establishment of Enterprises Knowledge Graph: By portraying our tens of millions of enterprise customers with data-driven methods on massive data(~TB), we optimized our all-scenario models significantly. Our significance included but not limited to:
