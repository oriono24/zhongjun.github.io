<br>

**University of Science and Technology of China**
- B.Sc. in Statistics, Distinguished Graduates Award*(2014.08-2018.06)*

  Graduation Thesis: "Stock Market Predictability Estimation with Machine Learning". We proved and measured the incomplete efficiency of the stock market by constructing some clever market cases that are predictable by some 'not-fancy' machine learning methods.

### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

**Data Center Brain Lab, Alibaba Cloud**
  - Supply Chain Demand Forecast: My team focused on supply chain demand forecast method to better optimize the stocking strategy of millions of servers (cloud computing resources). Our latest method gains no less than 5% in MAPE compared to any published method(Prophet/Amazon Forecast/or any traditional statistical time series prediction method). Our work leaded to more than 100 million$ cost saving per year(since I joined). 
  - Establishment of Enterprises Knowledge Graph: By portraying our tens of millions of enterprise customers with data-driven methods on massive data(~TB), we optimized our all-scenario models significantly. Our significance included but not limited to:
    - customer churning prediction
    - commodity recommendation system
    - customer billing service: billing prediction, purchasing method optimization, etc

**Joint Intelligent Computing Lab of USTC and Birmingham University, University of Science and Technology of China**
  - We tackles Submodularity Subset Selection under various constraints(NP). Considering the traditional stable solution with an approximation ratio of 1/e, we try to find a better solution based on stocastic methods (from the perspective of probability and computing efficiency instead of a better approximation ratio)
