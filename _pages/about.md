## EDUCATION
**University of Michigan--Ann Arbor**
- MS student in Industrial and Operations Engineering(2022.08-Present)
<br>

**University of Science and Technology of China**
- B.Sc. in Statistics, *Distinguished Graduates Award*(2014.08-2018.06)

  Bachelor Thesis: *"Stock Market Predictability Estimation with Machine Learning"*. We proved and measured the incomplete efficiency of the stock market by constructing some clever market cases that are predictable by some 'not-fancy' machine learning methods.

## INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE
**Alibaba Group Holding Limited**
- Algorithm Engineer II(2019.07-2022.07)
  - As a *tech lead* since 2020.09 
- Algorithm Engineer I(2018.07-2019.06)
<br>

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

**Data Center Brain Lab, Alibaba Cloud Computing Co. Ltd.**
  - Supply Chain Demand Forecast: 
    - My team focused on the supply chain demand forecast method to better optimize the stocking strategy of millions of cloud computing servers. Our latest method(till I resign) gains no less than 5% in MAPE compared to any published method(Prophet/Amazon Forecast/etc.). Our work led to more than $100 million cost saving per year(since I joined). 
  - Establishment and Embedding of Knowledge Graph on Economy: 
    - By combining external economic data and data from our tens of millions of enterprise customers to build a huge knowledge graph, we optimized our all-scenario models significantly with knowledge graph embedding. Our significance included but is not limited to:
      - customer churning prediction
      - commodity recommendation system

**Joint Intelligent Computing Lab of USTC and Birmingham University, University of Science and Technology of China**
  - Stochastic Optimization on Submodular Subset Selection: 
    - Considering the traditional greedy solution with an approximation ratio of 1/e, we tried to find a better solution based on stochastic methods (from the perspective of probability and computing efficiency instead of a better approximation ratio)
